<h1>1.2 Integers and Real Numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#integers-and-real-numbers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We can represent <em>everything</em> in the computer using patterns of binary digits.</p>
<p>Integers, fractions, characters, images, sound, video….</p>
<p>It all depends on how we interpret the sequence of bits. A sequence might be interpreted as
an integer, or we might interpret it to mean a certain character (eg a capital A), or it might
represent a pixel in an image.</p>
<p>Before we get to an explanation of techniques for representing numbers in a binary sequence, I’d
like to discuss the way we organise the bits in the memory of a computer.</p>
<div class="section" id="memory">
<h2>Memory<a class="headerlink" href="#memory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Computer memory is made up of switches (actually transistors - an electronic switch) that represent the ones and zeros of binary numbers.</p>
<p>Instead of being a very long sequence of these switches, the memory is divided into equal size chunks.
Modern computers use chunks of eight of these switches and each chunk is called a <strong>BYTE</strong>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The Burroughs B1000 series computers from the 1970’s did not have a fixed chunk size.
Instead of 8 bit bytes, the programmers could choose any size they wanted.</p>
</div>
<p>You can think of computer memory as a sequence of these 8-bit bytes. The position of each byte in the sequence is
the <strong>address</strong> of the byte.   The computer can easily retrieve an individual byte using the address of the byte.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In the case of the Burroughs B1000 series, the individual bits were numbered, so the machine
was described as <em>bit addressable</em></p>

<div class="section" id="numbers-integers">
<h2>Numbers: integers<a class="headerlink" href="#numbers-integers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If we use a single 8-bit byte for integers we impose a limit on the range of values that can be represented.</p>
  <div class="fitb">
        <p>The number of different values we can represent in 8-bits is <input type="text" id="Q1" data-component="binary">.</p>
        <button type="button" onclick="sendfitb('Q1')">Check</button>
        <script id="Q1-answers" type="application/json">
        [

{ "regex": "256", "feedback": " Correct!", "result": ""  }  ,
{ "regex": "255", "feedback": " Wrong. Did you forget to include 0?", "result": ""  }  ,
{ "regex": "x", "feedback": " Oops... wrong.  The range goes from 00000000 to 11111111.  00000000 is 0 and 11111111 is 255. Try again.", "result": ""  }          ]
</script>
<p id="Q1-feedback"> <p>
</script>

</div><p>To represent a large range of values we could add more bits. For example, 2 bytes or 16 bits would let us represent many more integers.</p>
<p>Do you think it is possible to represent ALL integers in a computer?</p>
<p>The answer is <strong>NO</strong>! The reason is that computers have a finite amount of memory, and in mathematics there are an infinite number of integers
and they can be infitely large.   We have to impose a limit somewhere.</p>
<p>As well as integers we also want to represent negative numbers and fractions. How do we do that in the computer where we only have bits
and no minus sign or point?</p>
<p>In the case of negative integers, we have to choose a way of interpreting the existing bits as either a positive or negative number.
One way to do this is to reserve one of the bits to mean a sign, eg 0 means positive, 1 means negative.
In the past, some computers did this and typically assigned the left most bit (most significant) to be the sign bit.
This representation is called “sign and magnitude”.</p>
<p>Modern computers use another method called “two’s complement” representation, and that’s the method we will describe in more detail.</p>
<p>To make it a bit easier, we will assume we have only a 4-bit chunk to represent our integers.  If we only represent positive
integers we can have 0000 to 1111  or 0-15, 16 different patterns and so 16 different values.</p>

<p>Another way to think about this is in the form of a number circle:</p>
<img alt="_images/number-2.png" src="_images/number-2.png" />
<p>That circle shows the interpretation of the four bit patterns and unsigned integers.</p>
<p>Here is another circle that shows what happens if we interpret the same patterns as 4 bit “2s complement” numbers:</p>
<img alt="_images/number-3.png" src="_images/number-3.png" />
<p>If we <em>only</em> have 4 bit numbers and we use 2’s complement interpretation, we can get some strange results if
we do arithmetic and don’t think about what happens when you exceed the 4 bits.</p>
<p>For example, what happens if you add 5 and 6?   Using the 2s complement number circle we start at 5 then go around the circle 6 steps
and end up at -5!  That’s because 5+6 is 11 which exceeds the capacity of a 4 bit 2s complement representation which can only represent integers
from -8 to +7.</p>
  <div class="fitb">
        <p>Using 4 bit 2s complement representation, what is the value of -4-7? <input type="text" id="Q2" data-component="numbers"></p>
        <button type="button" onclick="sendfitb('Q2')">Check</button>
        <script id="Q2-answers" type="application/json">
        [

{ "regex": "5", "feedback": " Correct!", "result": ""  }  ,
{ "regex": "+5", "feedback": " Correct!", "result": ""  }  ,
{ "regex": "-11", "feedback": " Wrong. Don't forget we only have 4 bits and we are using 2s complement. Try the number wheel.", "result": ""  }  ,
{ "regex": "x", "feedback": " Oops... wrong.  ", "result": ""  }          ]
</script>
<p id="Q2-feedback"> <p>
</script>

</div><p>These examples are trivial because we are using only 4 bits for our numbers. However, the same issues can arise with larger fields.
For example, a common method of representing intergers in a computer is to use 4 bytes, or 4 x 8 = 32 bits.</p>
  <div class="fitb">
        <p>How many positive integers can you represent in 32 bits? <input type="text" id="Q3" data-component="numbers"></p>
        <button type="button" onclick="sendfitb('Q3')">Check</button>
        <script id="Q3-answers" type="application/json">
        [

{ "regex": "4294967296", "feedback": "Correct.", "result": ""  }  ,
{ "regex": "x", "feedback": " Wrong. We can represent 2 raised to the power 32 different values, or 4294967296", "result": ""  }          ]
</script>
<p id="Q3-feedback"> <p>
</script>

</div><p>So if we can only represent about 4000 million or 4G positive integers then if we use 2s complement representation
we can only represent numbers in the approximate range of minus 2G to plus 2G.
We can still overflow 32 bits if we add two large integers!</p>
<p>Representing integers in 4 bytes is called <strong>single precision</strong>.  Some computers allow the use of 8 bytes, or <strong>double precisions</strong>.
What is the range of positive and negative integers that can be represented in 2s complement double precision?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="representing-real-numbers">
<h2>Representing Real Numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#representing-real-numbers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are many situations where you need to represent fractions, not just whole numbers.  For this, the computer needs a way of representing <strong>real numbers</strong>.
We know that our computers are finite and we have a limited number of bits to represent data, so any representation of real numbers will also have to be limited.</p>
<p>With real numbers we have to represent the fractional part as well as the whole number. This means we’ll have a limited <em>precision</em> as well as <em>range</em>.</p>
<p>Just as there are many ways to represent integers, there are also many ways to represent the parts of a real number.   A common way is “fixed point” representation
where we take our field of bits and divide it into fixed sized parts to represent the whole number and the fraction.</p>
<p>For example, we might have one byte for the whole number and one byte for the fraction and so get a number like:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mf">00101010.10000100</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The part to the left of the <em>binary</em> point is interpreted as a normal positive number. To the right of the point we
using <em>negative</em> powers of two for each position, so in the case the value is</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">^-</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">^-</span><span class="mi">6</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">64</span>  <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="mi">33</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">64</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="mf">0.51562</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The total value is 42.51562.</p>
<p>Fixed point representation suffers from the finite-ness problem already mentioned, but also has another problem.
It’s not very <em>efficient</em> at representing real numbers.  For example a number like:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mf">00101010.10000000</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This number is “wasting” a lot of zeros on the end. If we needed more digits in the whole number part to represent a big number
we have a problem.  We can’t re-use the unneccesary zeros on the end.</p>
<p>The solution was another, ingenious, method to represent real numbers. We allow the binary point to “float” to a position that makes
optimal use of the available bits.  It does this by storing the number in these two parts:  exponent and magnitude.   When we write large real numbers
in decimal we often use a method called “scientific notation”. This is exactly the same idea.</p>
<p>For example, the decimal number 315.82 could be expressed as:</p>
<img alt="_images/number-4.png" src="_images/number-4.png" />
<p>In binary we call this representation “floating point” and the magnitude is called the “mantissa”. We also arrange the bit pattern a little
differently and include an explicit sign bit:</p>
<img alt="_images/number-5.png" src="_images/number-5.png" />
<p>To make the representation even more efficient, we have to allow for very small numbers, less than one.  In order to avoid wasting bits in the mantissa
we need to represent a <em>negative</em> exponent.  We could do this using 2s complement representation that we have already covered, but in the most popular standard
for floating point numbers (IEEE-754) they use yet another method - “biased” representation where a fixed value is added to the number and the result
stored as an unsigned 8 bit number.</p>
<p>The last feature of floating point number representation I want to mention is that the numbers are “normalised”. The mantissa is shifted left or right until
there is a single 1 to the left of the binary point, and the exponent is adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>The widely used IEEE-754 floating number representation standard has three sizes:</p>
<table class="colwidths-given docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"></th>
<th class="head"><p>Size</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>single precision</p></td>
<td><p>32 bits</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>double precision</p></td>
<td><p>64 bits</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>extended precision</p></td>
<td><p>80 bits</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The reasons behind the floating representation are related to efficient use of the computer hardware, the logic. For example, if all floating point numbers are
normalised, then all numbers have a 1 to the left of the binary point, and so we don’t need to store it, so we save a bit.   Similarly, the exponent is stored in
biased representation because it makes it easier to do arithmetic.</p>
<p>On the subject of computer arithmetic:  there are a lot of traps that programmers can fall in to when using real numbers as represented in floating point.
Many numbers can not be represented exactly, for example take the decimal number 0.1 and try and represent it in binary fixed point with 16 bits for the fractional
part.  You can see that you can’t represent it accurately. This compounded if you now do arithmetic on the (innacurate) representation. So you might multiply your
number by 10 and then test the result to see if it equals 1 (0.1 x 10).  You might be surprised by the result.</p>
<p>The subject of floating point number representation and floating point arithmetic could occupy several University level courses!
So that’s all I’ll say about them here.</p>
<p>There are many other ways to represent numbers as binary patterns.   The Python language represents integers in a form that allows arbitrary length numbers
and arithmetic on them. Try a simple loop to calculate factorial 100. The result is a very long integer.</p>
<p>Real numbers can also be represented by “rational” numbers - pairs of integers. There are software libraries that implement rational number
representation but I don’t know of any current computer hardware that does this.</p>
<p>That completes our introduction to representing numbers as binary values in a computer.</p>
