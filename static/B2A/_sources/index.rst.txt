.. Each section heading (e.g. "SECTION 1: A Random Section") will be
   a heading in the table of contents. Source files that should be
   generated and included in that section should be placed on individual
   lines, with one line separating the first source filename and the
   :maxdepth: line.

.. Sources can also be included from subfolders of this directory.

1.0 Introduction
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This book is based on material that was developed by me, Bob Kummerfeld, for the University of Sydney
School of Computer Science INFO1112 course in 2020. That was the year the pandemic started and
we had to rapidly pivot from conventional face-to-face lectures and labs to fully online delivery.

I spent several months creating videos for each segment of material, each with self test quiz questions.
I've taken this material and converted it into book format using the Sphinx document processor and a
small preprocessor program that I wrote to add a few extra features.

Eventually I plan to enable a user login system with a backend personal user model for each registered
user. Then I can add a simple dashboard display that allows users to see where they are up to in the material,
what should be done next, what the main concepts are etc.

The material is arranged in a series of web pages, each with text, graphics, embedded self test exercises and short video.
