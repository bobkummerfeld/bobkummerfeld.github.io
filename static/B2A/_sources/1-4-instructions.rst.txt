1.4 Instructions
::::::::::::::::

The last simple type and how it is represented by binary numbers that I want to describe are computer **instructions**.
Computer instructions are the building blocks of computer programs. They are instructions to the computer hardware, the
Central Processing Unit or CPU, to carry out some operation. The operations performed by the CPU are very simple, eg
add two numbers together, copy one part of the memory to another part, compare two areas of memory and execute different
subsequent instructions depending on the result.  By creating **sequences** of instructions (also known as **programs**)
we can get the computer hardware to do what we want.

The storage of program instructions in the same memeory as the data (numbers, characters etc) was one of the breakthrough ideas that
made modern computers possible.  Before this idea (credited to John von Neumann in 1945) programs were often store elsewhere,
for example on electrical plug-boards in the case of the ENIAC computer that was completed in 1945 at the University of Pennsylvania.
In order to change a program, the programmers had to rewire the plugboard and this often took days or weeks. If the program instructions
were represented in the same main memory as data, the program could be changed like any other data item.

Before I start on the description of computer instructions I want to revisit the computer memory, specifically
memory *addresses*.  Each byte in the memory is numbered and this number is the address of the byte.   Inside programs,
particular bytes are referred to by their address.  So, when an instruction wants use a value from memory, it specifies the
address.  A program consists of a sequence of instructions stored in the memory, and they are also referred to by a memory
address.

As well as memory, a  modern computer has set of smaller memories called **registers** that are used during program execution.
It is possible to build a computer without these, but the speed of the computer would be drastically reduced. The reason is that
the speed of operation of the main memory is much much slower than the technology used to build these smaller memories or registers.
The registers are also special purpose, not for general use but for use in operations such as arithmetic or instruction decoding.

One very special register is called the **program counter** or PC.
The PC contains the address of the instruction that is being executed.
Since you could potentially have instructions anywhere in the memory, the PC
is the size of a memory address.
So if the maximum memory size of your computer is 4Gigabytes then the PC is 32 bits.

By storing a value in the PC we indicate where the next instruction is. After instructions
are executed (mostly) the PC is increased to the address of the next instruction in the sequence.
I say "mostly" because there are instructions that change the PC to the address of instructions
somewhere else. This is what we call a "jump", causing the program to jump to somewhere else in the memory
and start executing from that point.
