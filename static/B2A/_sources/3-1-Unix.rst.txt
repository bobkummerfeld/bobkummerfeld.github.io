3.1 Unix/Linux
::::::::::::::

When you run a program in a Linux system, the only way a program can access files or services is
via the operating system.  As we saw, this is achieved using "system calls" - a special interrupt
with parameters that requests a service. On Linux there are is a large number of system calls (over 300).
These can be divided into the following categories:

    Process management
        creating and terminating;
        managing attributes;
        managing memory allocation;
        sending signals
    File management
        create, delete,
        open, close,
        read, write,
        managing file attributes and permissions
    System Information
        managing information about the system
    Communication
        create, terminate connection;
        send, receive messages

A key part of any Unix system are the files, so I will start by describing the file system and the file
management system calls.
