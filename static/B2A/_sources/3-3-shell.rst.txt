3.3 Command Line
::::::::::::::::

Early computers had very simple input and output devices.  They usually had a device
with a simple typewriter-like printer with an integrated keyboard. These evolved from
communication devices called "teleprinters". Here is one from the 1930s by the Seimens company:

By the time Unix was in development, the "Teletype model 33" was a commonly used teleprinter that used the ASCII
code for characters that it printed or read from the keyboard.

The teletype device could print one character at a time and read one character at a time from the keyboard.
The character I/O was carried out by the operating system on behalf of the user program.  The teletype also
allowed the common "control characters" like newline, carriage return and tab.  The result was that everything
you did on the computer was line oriented. You printed lines of text with your results, you typed a line of input
(followed by "return").

This "line orientation" continued with early Unix and right into the 1980s when graphical displays and mouse input
were invented.
It also gave rise to the idea of the "command line".   A user sat at the teletype and entered a command to
the operating system which then interpreted it and carried out some operation.

The major innovation that Unix made to the command line was to make the command interpreter a normal user program and
not part of the operating system kernel.  Anyone can write their own command interpreter for Unix and there
are many popular command interpreters written by users.

.. admonition:: The Shell

   The original idea for a user program as command interpreter comes from Multics, the system developed
   at MIT in the 1960s. Ken Thompson included this in Unix and kept the original name for such programs:
   the shell.
