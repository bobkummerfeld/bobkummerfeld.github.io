<h1>1.3 Characters<a class="headerlink" href="#characters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As I said before, we can represent <em>everything</em> in the computer using patterns of binary digits.</p>
<p>This includes characters - codes that indicate a shape that we print on a page or display on a screen.
Characters are probably the most common entities that are stored and manipulated in computers. We use them in documents,
web pages, notifications, presentations, books and so on. They are the mechanism we use to communicate between
humans and computers and so are incredibly important.</p>
<p>In the early days of computers we mainly used print.  Messages from the computer were printed on paper. But today most interaction
is via graphics on screens. This gives great flexibility but also makes the discussion of character representation in binary a lot more complicated.</p>
<p>The graphical representation of a character is sometimes called a “grapheme” and I’ll use that term
to describe what the character looks like when displayed.   This can get very confusing because there are usually many representations
of a character that can be displayed - multiple fonts, multiple font sizes etc. These different graphical representations are usually called
“allographs” of the grapheme.</p>
<p>To avoid some of the confusion I will just refer to the graphemes as <strong>characters</strong>. Characters can have multiple graphical representations (fonts, size etc)
on the screen, but I will cover that aspect of the representation separately. But, there is still some confusion because many languages draw a distinction
between upper and lower case versions and use separate representations (codes) for each version.
And, of course there are the annotations on characters such as <em>diacritical marks</em>.  Then there are languages like Chinese that has thousands of characters
in common use. I will start by describing how represent characters used in English.</p>
<div class="section" id="binary-patterns-to-represent-characters">
<h2>Binary patterns to represent characters<a class="headerlink" href="#binary-patterns-to-represent-characters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since the memory of most computers is divided into 8-bit bytes that are individually addressable, it makes sense that we use a byte to
represent a single character.   With 8 bits we can represent 256 characters and in normal English this is certainly enough to represent
the alphabetic, numeric and special characters. The most commonly used encoding for English characters was developed by the American Standards Association
and released in 1963. It is called the American Standard Code for Information Interchange or ASCII. It uses 7 bits and so can represent 128 individual
characters.  Each group of 7 bits is stored in a single byte, with the 8th bit often used as a method of error detection called a “parity bit”.
If the last bit is not used as a parity bit it is set to zero.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The value of a parity bit is calculated by counting the number of 1 bits in the field.
If the system uses <strong>even</strong> parity then the parity bit is set to zero if there are an even number of  1 bits in the field.
If the system uses <strong>odd</strong> parity then the parity bit is set to zero if there are an odd number of  1 bits in the field.
This bit can be checked to see if something has changed in the field.</p>
</div>
<p>ASCII has codes for upper and lower case alphabetical characters, numbers, space and a selection of “special” characters.
These codes use only 95 of the available 128 code values. The rest of the code values are called “control characters” and were originally
used as signals to an external device to do something.  This is now largely historical, with the exception
of the “tab”, “backspace”, “line feed” and “carriage return”
characters that indicate where on the screen the next character should appear.</p>
