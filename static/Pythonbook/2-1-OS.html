<h1>2.1 Operating Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#operating-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Early computers (and modern microcontroller computers) ran just one program at at a time. The
original machines had a program loaded in to the memory, it ran and produced output and terminated.
Then an operator fed in another program and so on.    Microcontrollers are the small computers we
use to monitor and control things. For example your microwave oven, or your airconditioning system.
They usually have low powered CPUs and limited memory. They are designed to be single purpose - just run a single
program to control something.</p>
<p>This is all fine if you only have a single task. But a desktop computer system, a mobile device or a network server
is vastly more complex, running dozens or even hundreds of programs.  They have sophisticated graphics, many I/O devices
used for human interaction, a file system, network connections.  They also need to run many of these programs “simultaneously”,
or they appear to be simultaneous anyway.  An overarching requirement is that each program needs to be secure from interference
(accidental or otherwise) from other programs running in the same computer.</p>
<p>To provide all these services, including security, we run our programs under the control of special, privileged, program
called an <strong>operating system</strong>.</p>
<p>Microcontrollers are simple and fun to program.   The Arduino company has produced a system that makes it easy to
write programs for many microcontrollers (originally the Atmel 8-bit AVR microprocessors).  For just a few dollars
you can buy a microcontroller board that has many i/o bits and even wifi. The Arduino software is free and easy to use and
it allows you to write programs in a version of the C++ language. There is a large library of functions that can be used
to develop programs that interact with sensors and devices as well has communicate using common internet protocols. But
Arduino systems do not have an operating system. Your program is the only program running on the computer. It doesn’t need
security from other programs because your program is the only one. If it needs a sophisticated user interface, your program
has to implement it.</p>
<p>Desktop systems from Microsoft or Apple run a sophisticated operating system that provides many services and security.
The operating system that I will describe in detail is probably one that you aren’t familiar with but in fact you probably use
it every day. The system has been around for a very long time and now has many different versions, all of them look very similar.
The operating system is called <strong>Unix</strong> and in some version or another it is the system used behind-the-scenes in nearly all mobile phones
and tablets as well has the vast majority of server system (web servers, databases etc).</p>

<h2>UNIX<a class="headerlink" href="#unix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a> operating system and its variants have a long history.
It was invented long long ago (1969) in Bell Laboratories (New Jersey, USA), mainly by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, but many others have contributed
since the beginning. The key concepts that continue in the system until today were developed by the mid-1970’s. The system really took off in popularity when
the source code was released, for free, to Universities in 1975.
That led to wide-spread adoption within Universities, initially in Computer Science Departments, but then right across campuses.</p>
<p>In the 1980’s Unix began to be used by the commercial world and the owner of the system, AT&amp;T, licenced it for a fee. Universities could still
use the original version but in 1991 a new version, completely rewritten, was released by a Finnish Software Engineer called Linus Torvalds. Linus called his
system “Linux”.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> was also adopted by Universities and since the source code was freely available and open-source, it began to be maintained and further developed
by a large number of enthusiastic programmers. Linux is now very widely used.  It is the basis for the Android system used in phones and tablets.
It is commonly used as the operating system for servers and cloud computing. Interestingly, Apple uses another version of Unix as the underlying
operating system for its products (Macintosh, iphone, ipad, Apple watch, Apple TV).</p>
<p>Almost all systems that have an operating system, with the exception of Microsoft Windows, are running a version of Unix.</p>
<p>For this reason I will use Unix as the operating system platform to describe how we get from the bits to the applications.</p>
