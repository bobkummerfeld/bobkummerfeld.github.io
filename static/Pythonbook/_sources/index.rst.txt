.. Here is were you specify the content and order of your new book.

.. Each section heading (e.g. "SECTION 1: A Random Section") will be
   a heading in the table of contents. Source files that should be
   generated and included in that section should be placed on individual
   lines, with one line separating the first source filename and the
   :maxdepth: line.

.. Sources can also be included from subfolders of this directory.
   (e.g. "DataStructures/queues.rst").

Introduction
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This document is an introduction to programming in the Python programming language.
It introduces key programming concepts and methods.
It illustrates how Python programmers make use of these to create programs in a Unix environment.

The document is divided into a set of topics and each topic is described in a similar format.
Within a topic there is first a description of the aspect of Python.
Then an example of the feature.

**NOTE**: this is initially **ONLY for the staff**. I will be enhancing the document over several weeks and may be able to make it
available to all students at the end of the semester as a "study aid". Please don't pass the link to anyone else ðŸ™ƒ
