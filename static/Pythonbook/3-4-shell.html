<h1>3.4 Command Line<a class="headerlink" href="#command-line" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Early computers had very simple input and output devices.  They usually had a device
with a simple typewriter-like printer with an integrated keyboard. These evolved from
communication devices called “teleprinters”. Here is one from the 1930s by the Seimens company:</p>

<p>By the time Unix was in development, the “Teletype model 33” was a commonly used teleprinter that used the ASCII
code for characters that it printed or read from the keyboard.</p>

<p>The teletype device could print one character at a time and read one character at a time from the keyboard.
The character I/O was carried out by the operating system on behalf of the user program.  The teletype also
allowed the common “control characters” like newline, carriage return and tab.  The result was that everything
you did on the computer was line oriented. You printed lines of text with your results, you typed a line of input
(followed by “return”).</p>
<p>This “line orientation” continued with early Unix and right into the 1980s when graphical displays and mouse input
were invented.
It also gave rise to the idea of the “command line”.   A user sat at the teletype and entered a command to
the operating system which then interpreted it and carried out some operation.</p>
<p>The major innovation that Unix made to the command line was to make the command interpreter a normal user program and
not part of the operating system kernel.  Anyone can write their own command interpreter for Unix and there
are many popular command interpreters written by users.</p>
<div class="admonition-the-shell admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">The Shell</p>
<p>The original idea for a user program as command interpreter comes from Multics, the system developed
at MIT in the 1960s. Ken Thompson included this in Unix and kept the original name for such programs:
the shell.</p>
</div>
<p>The idea behind the command line interpreter is very simple: the user types a line of text, the program reads the characters
and works out what the user wants to do (“the command”), and then does it.</p>
<p>For a simple command interpreter this could involve running a program and the “command” might be simply the name of the file containing the
program as well as some arguments.</p>
<p>A more complex command interpreter, such as most Unix/Linux shells, are much more sophisticated and are almost like a programming
language with variables and control structures.</p>
<section id="the-shell">
<h2>The Shell<a class="headerlink" href="#the-shell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For my examples, I’m going to use a shell command interpreter called “Bash”. This shell is included with most Unix systems and
is widely known and used. Knowledge of bash will transfer across all Unix systems. Bash is the standard shell for Linux systems.
The standard shell for Macos is zsh.</p>
<p>There are many other shell programs such as csh (c shell!), ksh, zsh etc. All have differences in the syntax of the commands they
interpret and facilities they offer. The basic idea is still the same: read a line from a keyboard and interpret it as a command to do something.</p>
<div class="admonition-bash admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">bash</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a> stands for “Bourne again shell” and is a pun.  <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne">Steve Bourne</a> was a programmer
at Bell Laboratories where Unix was developed. He developed a shell program that became known as the “Bourne Shell”.  This shell was re-implemented
as part of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU">gnu</a>  project and the result called the “Bourne again shell” or bash.</p>
</div>
<p>A command interpreter is conceptually very simple. It first displays a “prompt” string that tells the user that the shell is ready to read a
command line.  Rather than something wordy like “Next Command?” the prompt is often very small like a character or two (eg “$ “),
or is a little longer and carries extra information such as the name of the user or the directory they are currently working in.</p>
<p>Commands are character strings interpreted by the shell and may either be carried out completely by the shell, or are simply the names of programs
to be executed.</p>
<p>Here is an example session where the user types two commands: echo and date.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/3-4-shell-1.png"><img alt="_images/3-4-shell-1.png" class="align-center" src="_images/3-4-shell-1.png" style="width: 1014.4000000000001px; height: 420.0px;" /></a>
<p>The commands echo and date are actually programs that the shell command interpreter finds in the file system by looking in
standard places. The shell uses fork/exec to start the command program and passes the arguments that were typed by the user.
The program then runs and produces output. After the command terminates (ie the child process exits) the parent (ie the shell)
displays the prompt and waits for the next command to be entered by the user.</p>
<p>Anyone can write a shell program. It doesn’t require any special priviledges. A really simple shell just interprets the commands
typed by the user as program names and arguments. In this case the shell finds the program and runs it. Most shells, however, are much more complex.
They provide many more sophisticated features that turn them into a full programming language complete with variables and control structures!
The bash shell is an example of this type of shell.</p>
<p>A description of bash will take a lot of content, so rather than go into the details now, I’m going to insert a branch here.
If you continue with the main stream of the ebook I will assume you know the basics of the shell. If you don’t know the basics I suggest
you read the shell branch starting here: <a class="reference external" href="shell-1.html">shell.1</a></p>
