      <description>This is my second blog entry, still recounting my history.
History - part 2 My story continues in 1980 when I was a tenured lecturer in Computer Science. At that time I had become interested in networks and the emerging internet in particular. Australia had a fragmented academic network at the time with the public X25 network and CSIROnet the only long haul options, with some use of dialup modems.</description>

      <description>First post on a new blog is the place to introduce myself. As the home page says I am currently (October 2017) an Honorary Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Sydney. I officially “retired” in 2013 and was immediately re-appointed on an honorary basis, doing most of what I did before: teaching and research. I have since reduced my teaching to one course per year plus helping out with small sequences of lectures in other courses (eg introducing Python to a first class etc) and the odd lecture in other courses.</description>
